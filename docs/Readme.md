## API :
* REST api's will be used as they are very fast and stateless protocol based
## Datebase
* In this project mongoDB is used as a database which is accessed using api calls .
* MongoDB is the best suitable database that is used because the structure of the data from the social media web applications are not very precise and hence has no specific structure .
* As this is a document based database this is the best database for this usecase .
